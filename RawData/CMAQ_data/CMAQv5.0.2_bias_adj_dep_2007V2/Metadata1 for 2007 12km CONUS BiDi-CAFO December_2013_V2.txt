Abstract: CMAQ annual deposition files for 2007 with adjusted wet deposition for the continental US using 12km grids. The dataset is based on output from the Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system (CMAQ) run using the bidirectional flux option for the 12-km grid size for the US, Canada, and Mexico.  There are separate files for deposition in units of kg/ha and meq/m^2.  The CMAQ output has been post-processed using R scripts to adjust the wet deposition for errors in the location and amount of precipitation and for regional biases in the TNO3 (HNO3 + NO3), NHx (NH4 + NH3), and sulfate wet deposition.  Model predicted values of dry deposition were not adjusted.  The wet deposition has been adjusted by PRISM precipitation and by a bias adjustment field.  The precipitation adjustment is based on increasing/decreasing the modeled wet deposition based on the bias in the modeled precipitation (bias=PRISM precipitation regridded to 12kmx12km CMAQ grid/modeled precipitation).  The bias field is based on regionally smoothing the bias at NADP sites by averaging the bias across all sites within 500km of a given monitor (bias = observed value/model value). These new averaged bias values at each NADP site are then kriged across space to all of the CMAQ grid cells to produce a smooth spatial map of a regional bias correction field for the CMAQ wet deposition predictions. (Note that since we are dealing with ratios, the averaging and kriging procedures are done on the log scale and then back-transformed.)  This bias adjustment was applied to the entire CONUS domain, including the West Coast.  The dry deposition is added, without adjustment, to the adjusted wet deposition to calculate total deposition. 

Purpose: Provide annual adjusted CMAQ deposition fields for 2007, with a bi-directional NH3 formulation and a dynamic CAFO emissions profile for critical loads analyses and as input to other ecological models where the most accurate wet deposition fields are desired (via precipitation and bias adjustments). 

Supplemental Information: 
The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system was run for the CONUS domain using a 12 km grid size and a Lambert Conformal projection assuming a spherical earth with radius 6370.0 km.  The following model options and inputs were used:
* Chemical Transport Model version is CMAQ v5.0.2 with bi-directional NH3 air-surface exchange using Massad formulation, CB05TUCL  chemical mechanism, aero6  aerosol module
* CMAQ v5.0.2 lightning NOx adjusted to lightning strike data
* GeosCHEM v 8-03-02 model created boundary conditions with hourly values from 2007 simulation using Geos5 meteorology
* Economic Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) chemical fertilizer application schedule that is year specific with chemical specification of form applied.
* New confined animal feeding operations (CAFO) resistance and thermodynamics-based diurnal profile calculation for NH3 emissions
* Biogenic Emissions Landuse Database, version 4 (BELD4) crop distributions in EPIC and CMAQ, and biogenic emissions.
* Anthropogenic emissions are from the 2007rh data set.  
* Weather Research Forecast model, version 3.4 (WRF v3.4) meteorology simulated for 2006 with 2006 NLCD land cover data and using version2 four-dimensional data assimilation with no nudging in the planetary boundary layer and based on blended 3-hourly reanalysis fields (combination of 6-hour (Meteorological Assimilation Data Ingest System) MADIS data and intermediate North American Mesoscale Model (NAM) 3-hour forecast) organized into 12km NAM Data Assimilation System (NDAS) fields up to 50 hPa, 
* WRF v3.4 with Kain-Fritsch Ma and Tan (2009) trigger; with NLCD woody wetlands land use category recognized (wetlands-100); with Pleim-Xiu land-surface model.
* WRF post-processing to create inputs for CMAQ was done with the Meteorology-Chemistry Input Processor (MCIP) v4.1.3.  There are 35 vertical layers from the surface to the top of the free troposphere with layer 1 nominally 19m tall.  
* December 2013 simulation date.
